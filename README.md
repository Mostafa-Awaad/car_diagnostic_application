### üöò About
The **Car Monitoring System Application** is a real-time vehicle diagnostics and monitoring solution designed using **Flutter** for the user interface and **Python** for backend data processing. It provides an interactive and visually appealing dashboard that streams various car signals in real-time using dynamic gauges for each signal.

---
### ‚ú® Features
- **Flutter Application**:
  
  - Displays real-time vehicle signals on an intuitive dashboard.
  - Uses custom gauges to visualize key metrics such as:
    - **Vehicle Speed**
    - **Fuel Level**
    - **Engine Coolant Temperature**
    - **Car Tire Pressure**
    - **Battery Health**
  - Real-time data streaming for a seamless user experience.
   #### a) üè¢ Architecture:
   - For achieving modularity, the architecture is divided into:
     - A general model for any vehicle data signal (speed, engine coolant temperature, fuel level, etc...).
     - Two dart files for dealing with all sorts of signals such as (fetching most recent row in supabase - handling new row - subscribing to real-time updates) and (extracting the signal from a specific index in the data frame) which is represented in (`signal_handler.dart`& `signal_processor.dart`) respectively.
     - each screen in the app has its own dart file.
     - Folder for widgets, where each widget extracts a specific car signal by utilizing functions in signal_handler and signal processor.
     - Folder for gauges, where each signal has its own gauge, which is responsible for how the signal will be represented.
   #### b)üßµüßµ Isolates:
    - Streaming multiple car signals is handled using isolates, which is multi-threading in other programming languages.
    - An isolate has a unique characteristic: it runs within its own chunk of memory, processing events independently. Unlike threads in other programming languages, isolates 
      do not share memory, ensuring better isolation and thread safety.
    - This ensures smooth running of the application without crashing.
   
- **Backend Python Script**:
  - Processes a **DBC (Database CAN)** file to decode CAN messages.
    ##### CAN DBC file (CAN Database) syntax:

  - Converts the DBC data into an **ASC (ASCII log)** file containing continuously generated rows of data.
  - Automatically uploads the parsed data from the ASC file to a **Supabase database table** in real-time.

- **Supabase Integration**:
  - Acts as the central data repository for storing vehicle signal information.
  - Provides real-time updates to the Flutter app by streaming the **latest row** from the database.

---
### üîó Workflow
1. **Data Processing**:
   - A Python script decodes vehicle data using a **DBC file** and generates an **ASC file** with continuous vehicle signal data.

2. **Data Storage**:
   - The Python script uploads each new line of the ASC file to a **Supabase table**, ensuring a real-time flow of data.
   - Snippet from the .asc file

3. **Real-Time Display**:
   - The Flutter application fetches the **latest row** from the Supabase table.
   - Displays the corresponding signals dynamically using **gauges** for an engaging and informative user.

     - Parse the last logged message in the .asc file and store it in the Supabase database.
3. **Database Table**:
   - Ensure the Supabase table `car_logs_2` has the following schema:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE car_logs_2 (
         message_number TEXT,
         timestamp DOUBLE PRECISION,
         can_message_id BYTEA,
         data_frame BYTEA,
         signal_type TEXT
     );
     ```

  - Example of inserted data:
    ```json
    {
        "message_number": "1",
        "timestamp": 1700000000.123456,
        "can_message_id": "Base64_encoded_binary_data",
        "data_frame": "Base64_encoded_binary_data",
        "signal_type": "Tx"
    }
    ```

### ‚ö† Notes

- **Error Handling**:
  - Logs errors in encoding CAN messages or parsing invalid lines.
- **Extensibility**:
  - Can be extended to handle real-time CAN data streams or other DBC definitions.
